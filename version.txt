V. A1.0.0

# This Version
This is a working version of the encryption cipher. The HTML has two simple forms. The JS is jQuery and has three main functions.

### Other Files
The script backup does not divide the three main parts into functions.

### Issues
The HTML is very bare, but it still bothers me how the form clears the value.

# Next Version
- Turn the functions into objects.
- Create the delimiter automatically.
- Use a more complicated additional.

### Very Future
Do a real HTML page with CSS. Also upload to Github.
